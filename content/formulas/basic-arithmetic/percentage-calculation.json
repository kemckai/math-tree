  "explanation": "A percentage represents a part of a whole as a fraction of 100. To find a percentage, divide the part by the whole and multiply by 100. To find what a percentage represents, multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by the whole. Percentages are useful for comparing proportions and understanding relative amounts.",

      "problem": "What percentage is 15 out of 60?",
      "solution": "25%",
      "steps": [
        "Part = 15, Whole = 60",
        "Percentage = (15/60) × 100",

        "40 = 0.20 × Whole",
