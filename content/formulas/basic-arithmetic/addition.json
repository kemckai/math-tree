  "explanation": "Addition is one of the four basic arithmetic operations. It represents combining two or more numbers to get a total or sum. The numbers being added are called addends, and the result is called the sum. Addition is commutative (a + b = b + a) and associative ((a + b) + c = a + (b + c)).",
