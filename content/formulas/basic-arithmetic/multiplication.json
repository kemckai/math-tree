  "explanation": "Multiplication is repeated addition. When we multiply a by b, we're adding a to itself b times. Multiplication is commutative (a × b = b × a), associative ((a × b) × c = a × (b × c)), and distributive over addition (a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c). The identity element is 1 (any number times 1 equals itself).",
