  "explanation": "Subtraction is the inverse operation of addition. It represents finding the difference between two numbers. When we subtract b from a, we're asking 'how much more is a than b?' or 'what do we need to add to b to get a?'. Unlike addition, subtraction is not commutative (a - b ≠ b - a in general).",
