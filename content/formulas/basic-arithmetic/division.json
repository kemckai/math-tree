  "explanation": "Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. When we divide a by b, we're asking 'how many times does b fit into a?' or 'what number multiplied by b gives us a?'. Division by zero is undefined. Division is neither commutative nor associative. The result is called the quotient.",
