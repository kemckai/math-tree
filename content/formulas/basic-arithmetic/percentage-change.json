  "explanation": "Percentage change measures how much a value has increased or decreased relative to its original value. A positive percentage indicates an increase, while a negative percentage indicates a decrease. This formula is commonly used in economics, statistics, and everyday situations like price changes or population growth.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "A shirt originally costs $40 and is now $50. What is the percentage increase?",
      "solution": "25% increase",
      "steps": [
        "Old Value = $40, New Value = $50",
        "Change = 50 - 40 = 10",
        "Percentage Change = (10/40) × 100 = 25%",
        "Since it's positive, it's a 25% increase"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "A stock price dropped from $100 to $75. What is the percentage decrease?",
      "solution": "25% decrease",
      "steps": [
        "Old Value = $100, New Value = $75",
        "Change = 75 - 100 = -25",
        "Percentage Change = (-25/100) × 100 = -25%",
        "This is a 25% decrease"
