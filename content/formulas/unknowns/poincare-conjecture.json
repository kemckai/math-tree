  "latex": "\\text{Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere}",
  "explanation": "Henri Poincaré's 1904 conjecture was one of the most famous problems in topology. It asks whether a 3-dimensional space with no holes (simply connected) that is finite and has no boundary must be equivalent to a 3-sphere. This was one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems. In 2002-2003, Grigori Perelman proved it using Ricci flow, but declined the $1 million prize. This was the first Millennium Prize Problem to be solved.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "What did Perelman prove?",
      "solution": "That any 3-dimensional space without holes that is finite and closed must be topologically equivalent to a 3-sphere",
      "steps": [
        "Poincaré asked: How do you tell if a 3D space is a sphere?",
        "In 2D, a circle is the only simply connected closed surface",
        "In 3D, the answer was unknown for 100 years",
        "Perelman used Ricci flow to prove it's the 3-sphere",
        "This solved a century-old problem"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "Why did Perelman decline the prize?",
      "solution": "He declined both the Fields Medal and Millennium Prize, saying the proof was more important than recognition",

        "Perelman proved the conjecture in 2002-2003",
        "Awarded Fields Medal in 2006 (declined)",
        "Awarded Millennium Prize in 2010 (declined)",
        "He said 'I'm not interested in money or fame'",
