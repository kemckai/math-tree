  "latex": "\\text{Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes}",
  "explanation": "Christian Goldbach's 1742 conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory. It states that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. For example: 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 3 + 5, 10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5. The conjecture has been verified for all even numbers up to 4 × 10¹⁸, but no general proof exists. It's a simple statement about prime numbers that has resisted solution for nearly 300 years.",
