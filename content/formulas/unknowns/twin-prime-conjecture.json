  "latex": "\\text{There are infinitely many pairs of primes } (p, p+2)",
  "explanation": "The Twin Prime Conjecture asks whether there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by 2, such as (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19). While it seems obvious that such pairs should continue forever, no one has proven it. In 2013, Yitang Zhang proved there are infinitely many prime pairs with gap ≤ 70,000,000 (later reduced to 246). This was a major breakthrough, but the original conjecture (gap = 2) remains open.",
