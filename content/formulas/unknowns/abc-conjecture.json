  "explanation": "The ABC Conjecture (proposed by Oesterlé and Masser in 1985) connects number theory and Diophantine equations. It relates the size of numbers a, b, c (where a + b = c) to the product of their distinct prime factors. If proven, it would solve many famous problems including Fermat's Last Theorem (in a simpler way) and provide bounds on solutions to many Diophantine equations. In 2012, Shinichi Mochizuki claimed a proof, but it's written in a new mathematical framework that few can understand, and the proof remains controversial.",
