  "latex": "\\text{For any positive integer } n: \\text{ if } n \\text{ is even, divide by 2; if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat. Always reaches 1.}",
  "explanation": "Lothar Collatz's 1937 conjecture is deceptively simple: Start with any positive integer. If it's even, divide by 2; if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat. The conjecture states you'll always eventually reach 1. Despite being checked for numbers up to 2⁶⁸, no counterexample has been found, but no proof exists. Mathematician Paul Erdős said 'Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.' It's been called the simplest unsolved problem in mathematics.",

        "Start: 7 (odd) → 3×7+1 = 22",

      "problem": "Why is this problem so difficult?",

        "Some numbers take many steps (27 takes 111 steps)",
        "The sequence can grow very large before decreasing",
        "No pattern has been found to predict behavior",
        "It connects to deep questions in number theory",
