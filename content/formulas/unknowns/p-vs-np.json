  "explanation": "The P vs NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified (NP) can also be quickly solved (P). P problems can be solved in polynomial time. NP problems can be verified in polynomial time, but we don't know if they can be solved efficiently. If P = NP, many currently intractable problems (like factoring large numbers, solving Sudoku optimally, or protein folding) would become easy. This would break most modern cryptography. Most experts believe P ≠ NP, but no one has proven it. Worth $1 million (Millennium Prize Problem).",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "What would P = NP mean for cryptography?",
      "solution": "Most encryption methods (RSA, AES, etc.) would become breakable, requiring a complete redesign of internet security",
      "steps": [
        "Factoring large numbers is in NP",
        "If P = NP, factoring becomes easy",
        "RSA encryption relies on factoring being hard",
        "All current cryptographic systems would be vulnerable",
        "Would need quantum-resistant or new encryption methods"
