  "latex": "\\text{The rank of an elliptic curve's group of rational points equals the order of vanishing of its L-function at } s=1",
  "explanation": "This Millennium Prize Problem connects number theory and geometry. It relates the number of rational solutions to an elliptic curve equation to the behavior of an associated L-function. Elliptic curves are crucial in cryptography (used in Bitcoin and secure communications) and number theory. Proving this would give us powerful tools to find all rational points on elliptic curves and advance our understanding of Diophantine equations.",

      "problem": "Why are elliptic curves important?",
      "solution": "They're used in cryptography (Bitcoin, secure communications) and are fundamental objects in number theory",
      "steps": [
