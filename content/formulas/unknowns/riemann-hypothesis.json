  "explanation": "Bernhard Riemann's 1859 hypothesis is one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. It concerns the zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s). The hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros have real part equal to 1/2. This problem is worth $1 million (Millennium Prize Problem) and has profound implications for number theory, particularly the distribution of prime numbers. If proven, it would revolutionize our understanding of primes and cryptography.",
