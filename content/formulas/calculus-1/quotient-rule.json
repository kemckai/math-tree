  "latex": "\\frac{d}{dx}[\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}] = \\frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}",
  "explanation": "The quotient rule finds the derivative of a quotient (division) of two functions. The formula is: derivative of top times bottom, minus top times derivative of bottom, all divided by bottom squared. Remember: 'low d-high minus high d-low, over low squared' helps memorize this rule.",

  "proof": "For f(x) = u(x)/v(x), rewrite as f(x) = u(x)[v(x)]^(-1). Apply product rule: f'(x) = u'(x)[v(x)]^(-1) + u(x)(-1)[v(x)]^(-2)v'(x) = u'(x)/v(x) - u(x)v'(x)/[v(x)]\u00b2. Common denominator: = [u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)]/[v(x)]\u00b2."
