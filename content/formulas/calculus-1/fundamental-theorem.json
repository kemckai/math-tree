  "latex": "\\int_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a) \\text{ where } F'(x) = f(x)",
  "explanation": "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration. Part 1 states that if F is an antiderivative of f, then the definite integral from a to b equals F(b) - F(a). This allows us to evaluate definite integrals without using Riemann sums. It's called 'fundamental' because it establishes the deep relationship between these two main operations of calculus.",
