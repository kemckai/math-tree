  "explanation": "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects differentiation and integration. Part 1 states that if F is an antiderivative of f, then the definite integral from a to b equals F(b) - F(a). This allows us to evaluate definite integrals without using Riemann sums. It's called 'fundamental' because it establishes the deep relationship between these two main operations of calculus.",

  "proof": "Part 1: If F(x) = \u222b[a to x] f(t)dt, then F'(x) = f(x). Proof: F'(x) = lim(h\u21920) [F(x+h) - F(x)]/h = lim(h\u21920) [\u222b[a to x+h] f(t)dt - \u222b[a to x] f(t)dt]/h = lim(h\u21920) [\u222b[x to x+h] f(t)dt]/h. By Mean Value Theorem, there exists c in [x, x+h] such that \u222b[x to x+h] f(t)dt = f(c)h. As h\u21920, c\u2192x, so F'(x) = lim(h\u21920) f(c) = f(x). Part 2: If F'(x) = f(x), then \u222b[a to b] f(x)dx = F(b) - F(a). This follows from Part 1 and the definition of antiderivative."
