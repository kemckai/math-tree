  "latex": "\\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)",
  "explanation": "The chain rule finds the derivative of composite functions (functions within functions). If y = f(g(x)), then dy/dx = f'(g(x)) \u00b7 g'(x). In words: derivative of the outer function (evaluated at the inner function) times the derivative of the inner function. This is essential for differentiating functions like sin(x\u00b2) or (x\u00b2 + 1)\u00b3.",

  "proof": "Let y = f(u) and u = g(x), so y = f(g(x)). By definition: dy/dx = lim(h\u21920) [f(g(x+h)) - f(g(x))]/h. Multiply by [g(x+h) - g(x)]/[g(x+h) - g(x)]: = lim(h\u21920) {[f(g(x+h)) - f(g(x))]/[g(x+h) - g(x)]} \u00d7 {[g(x+h) - g(x)]/h}. As h\u21920, g(x+h) - g(x) \u2192 0, so first factor \u2192 f'(g(x)) = f'(u), second factor \u2192 g'(x). Therefore: dy/dx = f'(u) \u00d7 g'(x) = f'(g(x)) \u00d7 g'(x)."
