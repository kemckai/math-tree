  "latex": "\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}",
  "explanation": "The power rule is one of the most fundamental rules for finding derivatives. To differentiate x raised to any power n, multiply by the exponent and decrease the exponent by 1. This rule works for any real number n (including fractions and negatives). It's the foundation for differentiating polynomials.",
  "examples": [

  "proof": "Using the limit definition of derivative: f'(x) = lim(h\u21920) [(x+h)^n - x^n]/h. Apply binomial theorem: (x+h)^n = x^n + nx^(n-1)h + ... + h^n. Subtract x^n: (x+h)^n - x^n = nx^(n-1)h + terms with h\u00b2 or higher. Divide by h: [(x+h)^n - x^n]/h = nx^(n-1) + terms with h. As h\u21920, all terms with h vanish, leaving nx^(n-1). Therefore, d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)."
