  "latex": "9 \\times n = 10n - n",
  "explanation": "To multiply any number by 9, multiply by 10 and subtract the original number. For single digits, you can use your fingers: hold up the number of fingers equal to the multiplier, the finger you're multiplying by goes down, fingers before it give tens digit, fingers after give ones digit. This works because 9 = 10 - 1.",

      "steps": [
        "Method 1: 7 × 10 = 70, then 70 - 7 = 63",
        "Method 2 (fingers): Hold up 10 fingers, put down 7th finger",
        "6 fingers before (tens) + 3 fingers after (ones) = 63"
