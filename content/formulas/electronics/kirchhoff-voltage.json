  "latex": "\\sum V = 0 \\text{ around any closed loop}",
  "explanation": "Kirchhoff's Voltage Law states that the sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit equals zero. This means the sum of voltage drops equals the sum of voltage rises. KVL is based on conservation of energy - you can't gain or lose energy by going around a loop. This law is essential for analyzing complex circuits and is used with Ohm's Law to solve for unknown voltages and currents.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "In a loop with a 12V battery and two resistors with 3V and 5V drops, what is the remaining voltage?",
      "solution": "4V drop across another component",
      "steps": [
        "KVL: Sum of voltages = 0",
        "12V (rise) - 3V (drop) - 5V (drop) - V_unknown = 0",
        "12 - 3 - 5 = V_unknown",
        "V_unknown = 4V"

  "proof": "\u03a3V = 0 around any closed loop. Conservation of energy: sum of voltage drops equals sum of voltage rises. Proof: Electric potential is conservative field, so work done around closed path is zero. This is Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL)."
