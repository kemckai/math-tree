  "latex": "\\sum I_{in} = \\sum I_{out} \\text{ at any node}",
  "explanation": "Kirchhoff's Current Law states that the sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving that node. This is based on conservation of charge - charge cannot accumulate or disappear at a point. Current flowing into a junction must equal current flowing out. KCL is essential for analyzing parallel circuits and complex networks, working together with KVL to solve circuit problems.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "At a node, 2A enters and currents of 0.5A, 0.8A, and I_x leave. Find I_x.",
      "solution": "0.7A",
      "steps": [
        "KCL: I_in = I_out",
        "2 = 0.5 + 0.8 + I_x",
        "2 = 1.3 + I_x",
        "I_x = 0.7A"
