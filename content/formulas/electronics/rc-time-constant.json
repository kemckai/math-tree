  "latex": "\\tau = RC",
  "explanation": "The RC time constant (τ = RC) determines how quickly a capacitor charges or discharges through a resistor. After one time constant, a capacitor reaches 63.2% of final voltage when charging, or drops to 36.8% when discharging. After 5 time constants (5τ), the capacitor is considered fully charged or discharged (99.3%). This is fundamental for timing circuits, filters, and signal processing.",
