  "explanation": "The RC time constant (\u03c4 = RC) determines how quickly a capacitor charges or discharges through a resistor. After one time constant, a capacitor reaches 63.2% of final voltage when charging, or drops to 36.8% when discharging. After 5 time constants (5\u03c4), the capacitor is considered fully charged or discharged (99.3%). This is fundamental for timing circuits, filters, and signal processing.",

  "proof": "\u03c4 = RC. Time for capacitor to charge to 63.2% (1 - 1/e) of final voltage. From differential equation: dV/dt = (V_s - V)/(RC). Solution: V(t) = V_s(1 - e^(-t/RC)). At t = \u03c4 = RC, V = V_s(1 - 1/e) \u2248 0.632V_s."
