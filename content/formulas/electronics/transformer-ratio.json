  "explanation": "Transformers transfer electrical energy between circuits through magnetic coupling, changing voltage and current while maintaining power (ideally). The voltage ratio equals the turns ratio (N₂/N₁). Current ratio is inverse - if voltage increases, current decreases. Transformers are essential for power distribution (stepping up for transmission, stepping down for use), isolation, and impedance matching. They only work with AC.",

      "problem": "A transformer has 100 turns primary and 500 turns secondary. If input is 120V, what is output?",
      "solution": "600V",
      "steps": [
        "V₂/V₁ = N₂/N₁",
        "V₂/120 = 500/100 = 5",
        "V₂ = 120 × 5 = 600V"

      "problem": "A step-down transformer has 10:1 ratio. If secondary current is 5A, what is primary current?",

      "steps": [
        "I₁/I₂ = N₂/N₁ = 1/10",
        "I₁ = 5 × 0.1 = 0.5A"
