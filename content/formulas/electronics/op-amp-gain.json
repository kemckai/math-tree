  "explanation": "Operational amplifiers (op-amps) are high-gain differential amplifiers, fundamental building blocks of analog electronics. In inverting configuration, gain is -R_f/R_in (negative means signal inversion). In non-inverting configuration, gain is 1 + R_f/R_in. Op-amps are used in amplifiers, filters, comparators, oscillators, and mathematical operations (addition, integration, differentiation). They're versatile, precise, and essential for signal processing.",
