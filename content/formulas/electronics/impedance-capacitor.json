  "explanation": "In AC circuits, capacitors oppose current flow with reactance (X_C), which decreases as frequency increases. Unlike resistance, reactance depends on frequency - capacitors block DC but pass AC, with better conduction at higher frequencies. This makes capacitors useful for filtering, coupling, and frequency-dependent circuits. The unit is ohms (Ω), just like resistance.",
