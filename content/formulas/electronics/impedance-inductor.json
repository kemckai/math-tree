  "explanation": "In AC circuits, inductors oppose current flow with reactance (X_L), which increases with frequency. Unlike capacitors, inductors pass DC easily but oppose AC, with stronger opposition at higher frequencies. This frequency-dependent behavior makes inductors useful for filtering, impedance matching, and frequency selection. The unit is ohms (Ω).",
