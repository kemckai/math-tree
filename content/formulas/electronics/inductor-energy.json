  "explanation": "Inductors store energy in a magnetic field. The energy stored equals half the inductance times the square of current. Inductors oppose changes in current - they resist current increases and maintain current when the source is removed. Used in filters, transformers, power supplies, and radio circuits. The inductance L is measured in henries (H).",

        "E = ½LI²",
        "E = ½ × 0.01 × 2²",
        "E = ½ × 0.01 × 4 = 0.02J = 20mJ"
