  "explanation": "Bandwidth (BW) is the range of frequencies a circuit passes, typically measured between -3dB points (half-power points). The quality factor (Q) measures how selective a resonant circuit is - higher Q means narrower bandwidth and better frequency selectivity. Q = f₀/BW, where f₀ is the resonant frequency. High Q circuits are used in radio tuning, filters, and oscillators where frequency selectivity is important.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "A resonant circuit has f₀ = 1MHz and Q = 100. What is the bandwidth?",
      "solution": "10kHz",
      "steps": [
        "BW = f₀/Q",
        "BW = 1×10⁶ / 100 = 10,000Hz = 10kHz"

      "problem": "A filter has 100kHz center frequency and 5kHz bandwidth. What is Q?",

      "steps": [
        "Q = f₀/BW",
        "Q = 100,000 / 5,000 = 20"
