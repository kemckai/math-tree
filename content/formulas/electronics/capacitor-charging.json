  "explanation": "Capacitors store electrical energy in an electric field. When charging through a resistor, voltage increases exponentially toward the supply voltage. The time constant τ = RC determines how fast charging occurs - after one time constant, voltage reaches 63.2% of final value. After 5 time constants, it's essentially fully charged. Capacitors are used for filtering, timing, energy storage, and coupling signals.",
