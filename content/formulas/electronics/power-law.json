  "explanation": "Electrical power (P) measures the rate at which energy is consumed or produced in a circuit, measured in watts (W). Power can be calculated three ways: P = VI (voltage times current), P = I²R (current squared times resistance), or P = V²/R (voltage squared divided by resistance). These formulas are equivalent and derived from Ohm's Law. Power determines component ratings, energy consumption, and heat generation in circuits.",
