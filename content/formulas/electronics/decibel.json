  "explanation": "Decibels are a logarithmic scale for expressing ratios, making it easier to work with large ranges of values. For voltage/current: dB = 20log₁₀(V_out/V_in). For power: dB = 10log₁₀(P_out/P_in). Common values: +3dB = 2× power, +6dB = 2× voltage, +20dB = 10× voltage. Decibels are used extensively in audio, RF, signal processing, and filter design.",
