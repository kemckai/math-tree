  "explanation": "Diodes are semiconductor devices that allow current to flow in only one direction. When forward-biased (positive voltage on anode), a silicon diode has approximately 0.7V drop across it. When reverse-biased, it blocks current (except for tiny leakage). Diodes are used for rectification (converting AC to DC), protection, voltage regulation, and signal processing. LEDs are special diodes that emit light when forward-biased.",

      "steps": [
        "Diode forward voltage drop ≈ 0.7V",
        "V_circuit = 5V - 0.7V = 4.3V"

      "problem": "An LED with 2V forward voltage is powered by 9V through a 350Ω resistor. What current flows?",

      "steps": [
        "V_resistor = 9V - 2V = 7V",
