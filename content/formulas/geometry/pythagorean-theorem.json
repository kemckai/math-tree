  "explanation": "In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) equals the sum of squares of the other two sides. This fundamental theorem connects geometry and algebra. It only applies to right triangles. The theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras.",

  "proof": "Geometric proof: Construct a square with side length (a+b). Inside, place four right triangles with legs a and b, arranged so their hypotenuses form a smaller square with side c. The area of the large square is (a+b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. The area is also equal to the four triangles (4 \u00d7 \u00bdab = 2ab) plus the inner square (c\u00b2). Therefore: a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2 = 2ab + c\u00b2. Subtracting 2ab from both sides: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2."
