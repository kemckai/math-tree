  "latex": "C = 2\\pi r = \\pi d",
  "explanation": "The circumference (perimeter) of a circle is 2\u03c0 times the radius, or \u03c0 times the diameter. This formula shows that circumference is directly proportional to radius\u2014doubling the radius doubles the circumference. The constant \u03c0 (pi) is approximately 3.14159 and represents the ratio of circumference to diameter for any circle.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Find the circumference of a circle with radius 7 cm",
      "solution": "14\u03c0 cm or approximately 43.98 cm",

        "C = 2\u03c0r",
        "C = 2\u03c0(7) = 14\u03c0 cm",

      "problem": "A circle has diameter 10. Find its circumference",

      "steps": [
        "C = \u03c0d",
        "C = \u03c0(10) = 10\u03c0",

  "proof": "C = 2\u03c0r. This is definition of \u03c0: \u03c0 = C/(2r) = C/d where d is diameter. Archimedes showed \u03c0 \u2248 3.14 by inscribing and circumscribing polygons."
