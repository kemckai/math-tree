  "latex": "C = 2\\pi r = \\pi d",
  "explanation": "The circumference (perimeter) of a circle is 2π times the radius, or π times the diameter. This formula shows that circumference is directly proportional to radius—doubling the radius doubles the circumference. The constant π (pi) is approximately 3.14159 and represents the ratio of circumference to diameter for any circle.",
  "examples": [

      "problem": "Find the circumference of a circle with radius 7 cm",
      "solution": "14π cm or approximately 43.98 cm",
      "steps": [
        "C = 2πr",
        "C = 2π(7) = 14π cm",
        "Using π ≈ 3.14159: C ≈ 43.98 cm"
