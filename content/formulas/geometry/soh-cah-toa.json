  "explanation": "SOH-CAH-TOA is a mnemonic for remembering the three basic trigonometric ratios in a right triangle. SOH: Sine = Opposite/Hypotenuse. CAH: Cosine = Adjacent/Hypotenuse. TOA: Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent. These ratios relate angles to side lengths in right triangles and are fundamental to trigonometry.",

  "proof": "In right triangle, sin(\u03b8) = opposite/hypotenuse, cos(\u03b8) = adjacent/hypotenuse, tan(\u03b8) = opposite/adjacent. Proof: By definition, in unit circle, point on circle at angle \u03b8 has coordinates (cos(\u03b8), sin(\u03b8)). In right triangle with angle \u03b8, similar triangles show these ratios equal the coordinate ratios, establishing the definitions."
