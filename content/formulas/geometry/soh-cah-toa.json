  "explanation": "SOH-CAH-TOA is a mnemonic for remembering the three basic trigonometric ratios in a right triangle. SOH: Sine = Opposite/Hypotenuse. CAH: Cosine = Adjacent/Hypotenuse. TOA: Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent. These ratios relate angles to side lengths in right triangles and are fundamental to trigonometry.",
