  "explanation": "The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. This is a fundamental concept in geometry. For special triangles like equilateral triangles (all sides equal), the perimeter is simply 3 times one side length.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Find the perimeter of a triangle with sides 5, 7, and 9",
      "solution": "21 units",
      "steps": [
        "P = a + b + c",
        "P = 5 + 7 + 9",
        "P = 21 units"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "An equilateral triangle has side length 6. Find its perimeter",
      "solution": "18 units",
      "steps": [
        "All sides are equal: a = b = c = 6",
        "P = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18",
        "Or: P = 3 × 6 = 18 units"
