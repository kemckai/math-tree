  "latex": "A = \\pi r^2",
  "explanation": "The area of a circle is π (pi, approximately 3.14159) times the square of the radius. The radius is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. This formula shows that area grows quadratically with radius—doubling the radius quadruples the area. π is an irrational number representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Find the area of a circle with radius 5 cm",
      "solution": "25π cm² or approximately 78.54 cm²",
      "steps": [
        "A = πr²",
        "A = π(5)² = π(25) = 25π cm²",
        "Using π ≈ 3.14159: A ≈ 78.54 cm²"

      "problem": "A circle has diameter 12. Find its area",
      "solution": "36π square units or approximately 113.10 square units",
      "steps": [
        "First find radius: r = diameter/2 = 12/2 = 6",
        "A = π(6)² = 36π",
        "A ≈ 113.10 square units"
