  "latex": "\\frac{dz}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\frac{dy}{dt}",
  "explanation": "The multivariable chain rule extends the chain rule to functions of multiple variables. If z = f(x,y) and x and y are functions of t, then dz/dt equals the sum of partial derivatives times the derivatives of the intermediate variables. This is essential for related rates problems and parametric curves in higher dimensions.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "If z = x²y, x = t², y = t³, find dz/dt",
      "solution": "dz/dt = 7t⁶",
      "steps": [
        "∂z/∂x = 2xy, ∂z/∂y = x²",
        "dx/dt = 2t, dy/dt = 3t²",
        "dz/dt = (2xy)(2t) + (x²)(3t²)",
        "= 2(t²)(t³)(2t) + (t²)²(3t²)",
        "= 4t⁶ + 3t⁶ = 7t⁶"
