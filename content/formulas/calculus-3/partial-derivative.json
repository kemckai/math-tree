  "explanation": "A partial derivative measures how a multivariable function changes with respect to one variable while holding others constant. The notation ∂f/∂x means 'partial derivative of f with respect to x'. To compute it, treat all other variables as constants and differentiate normally. Partial derivatives are fundamental to multivariable calculus.",
