  "explanation": "A partial derivative measures how a multivariable function changes with respect to one variable while holding others constant. The notation \u2202f/\u2202x means 'partial derivative of f with respect to x'. To compute it, treat all other variables as constants and differentiate normally. Partial derivatives are fundamental to multivariable calculus.",

  "proof": "\u2202f/\u2202x = lim(h\u21920) [f(x+h,y) - f(x,y)]/h, treating y as constant. Measures rate of change in x-direction. Similarly, \u2202f/\u2202y treats x as constant. Partial derivatives exist if these limits exist. Used in multivariable calculus to find extrema and gradients."
