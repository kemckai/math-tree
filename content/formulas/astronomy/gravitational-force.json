  "explanation": "Every mass attracts every other mass with force proportional to product of masses and inversely proportional to square of distance. This universal law explains orbits, tides, and gravitational interactions throughout the universe. Gravity is the weakest fundamental force but dominates on large scales. Used to calculate orbital velocities, escape velocities, and gravitational fields.",

  "proof": "F = Gm\u2081m\u2082/r\u00b2. Newton derived from Kepler's laws and his laws of motion. For circular orbit: F = mv\u00b2/r. Using Kepler's 3rd law: T\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/GM)r\u00b3, and v = 2\u03c0r/T, substitution gives F = GMm/r\u00b2. Universal constant G determined experimentally."
