  "explanation": "Dark matter is invisible matter detected only by gravitational effects. Galaxy rotation curves show stars orbit faster than visible mass predicts - indicating 5-10× more mass than visible. Dark matter makes up ~27% of universe. Composition unknown (WIMPs, axions, etc.). Essential for galaxy formation and structure.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Why do we know dark matter exists?",
      "solution": "Galaxy rotation curves - stars move too fast for visible mass",
      "steps": [
        "Expected: v ∝ 1/√r (Keplerian, like planets)",
        "Observed: v ≈ constant (flat rotation curve)",
        "Implies M(r) ∝ r (mass increases with distance)",
        "But visible mass concentrated in center",
        "Conclusion: invisible dark matter halo"

    {
      "problem": "What is dark matter?",
      "solution": "Unknown - doesn't interact with light, only gravity",
      "steps": [
        "Not normal matter (baryons)",
        "Doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light",
        "Detected only by gravitational effects",
        "Candidates: WIMPs, axions, primordial black holes"
