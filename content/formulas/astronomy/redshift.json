  "explanation": "Redshift (z) measures how much light wavelengths stretch due to universe expansion. z = Δλ/λ_emit. For nearby objects: z ≈ v/c. For distant objects, cosmological redshift reveals expansion history. Used to measure distances, velocities, and study early universe. High redshift objects are very distant and old.",
