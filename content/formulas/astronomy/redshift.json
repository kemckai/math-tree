  "explanation": "Redshift (z) measures how much light wavelengths stretch due to universe expansion. z = \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb_emit. For nearby objects: z \u2248 v/c. For distant objects, cosmological redshift reveals expansion history. Used to measure distances, velocities, and study early universe. High redshift objects are very distant and old.",

  "proof": "z = (\u03bb_obs - \u03bb_emit)/\u03bb_emit. For cosmological redshift, z = (1+z) - 1 where (1+z) is expansion factor. If universe expanded by factor (1+z), wavelengths stretch by same factor. For small z: z \u2248 v/c (Doppler shift). For large z: cosmological expansion dominates."
