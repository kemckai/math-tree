  "explanation": "Angular resolution is smallest angle telescope can distinguish. Limited by diffraction: θ = 1.22λ/D where λ is wavelength, D is aperture diameter. Larger telescopes have better resolution. Used to determine telescope capabilities and understand why we need large telescopes or interferometry for detailed observations.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Hubble Space Telescope has 2.4m aperture. What is angular resolution at visible light (550 nm)?",
      "solution": "0.057 arcseconds",
      "steps": [
        "θ = 1.22λ/D (in radians)",
        "θ = 1.22 × 550×10⁻⁹ / 2.4 = 2.79×10⁻⁷ rad",
        "Convert to arcseconds: θ = 2.79×10⁻⁷ × 206265 = 0.057 arcsec"

      "problem": "Why do we need very large telescopes?",
      "solution": "Resolution improves with diameter - need large D to see fine details",
      "steps": [
        "θ ∝ 1/D (inverse relationship)",
        "To see smaller details, need larger aperture",
