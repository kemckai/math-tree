  "explanation": "Parallax is apparent shift of nearby stars against distant background as Earth orbits Sun. Parallax angle (p) measured in arcseconds. Distance d = 1/p parsecs. This is fundamental method for measuring stellar distances. Works for stars within ~1000 parsecs. Used to calibrate other distance measurement techniques.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Star has parallax 0.1 arcseconds. What is distance?",
      "solution": "10 parsecs",
      "steps": [
        "d = 1/p",
        "d = 1/0.1 = 10 parsecs"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "Why is parallax limited to nearby stars?",
      "solution": "Parallax angles become too small to measure accurately for distant stars",
      "steps": [
        "Parallax decreases with distance",
        "At 1000 pc, parallax ≈ 0.001 arcseconds",
        "Current telescopes can measure ~0.01 arcseconds",
        "Beyond ~1000 pc, parallax too small"
