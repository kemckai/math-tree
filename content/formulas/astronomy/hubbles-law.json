  "latex": "v = H_0 d, \\quad H_0 \\approx 70 \\text{ km/s/Mpc}",
  "explanation": "Hubble's law: galaxies recede with velocity proportional to distance. v = H\u2080d where H\u2080 is Hubble constant (~70 km/s/Mpc). This reveals universe is expanding. Used to measure distances to galaxies and determine universe's age. Fundamental to cosmology - shows universe had beginning (Big Bang) and is expanding uniformly.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Galaxy is 100 Mpc away. What is recession velocity?",
      "solution": "7000 km/s",
      "steps": [
        "v = H\u2080d",
        "v = 70 \u00d7 100 = 7000 km/s"

      "problem": "What does Hubble's law tell us about the universe?",
      "solution": "Universe is expanding uniformly from all points",
      "steps": [
        "All galaxies moving away from us",
        "Farther = faster (proportional relationship)",
        "Implies universe expanding uniformly",
        "Extrapolating backward: universe had beginning"

  "proof": "v = H\u2080d. Discovered observationally by Hubble. Galaxies recede with velocity proportional to distance. This indicates universe expansion. H\u2080 \u2248 70 km/s/Mpc is Hubble constant. Age of universe \u2248 1/H\u2080 \u2248 13.8 billion years."
