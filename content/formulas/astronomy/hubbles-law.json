  "explanation": "Hubble's law: galaxies recede with velocity proportional to distance. v = H₀d where H₀ is Hubble constant (~70 km/s/Mpc). This reveals universe is expanding. Used to measure distances to galaxies and determine universe's age. Fundamental to cosmology - shows universe had beginning (Big Bang) and is expanding uniformly.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Galaxy is 100 Mpc away. What is recession velocity?",
      "solution": "7000 km/s",
      "steps": [
        "v = H₀d",
        "v = 70 × 100 = 7000 km/s"

        "All galaxies moving away from us",
        "Farther = faster (proportional relationship)",
