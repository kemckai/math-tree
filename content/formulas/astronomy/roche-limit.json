  "latex": "d_{Roche} = 2.456 R_p \\left(\\frac{\\rho_p}{\\rho_s}\\right)^{1/3}",
  "explanation": "Roche limit is minimum distance a satellite can orbit before tidal forces tear it apart. Depends on planet radius (R_p), planet density (ρ_p), and satellite density (ρ_s). Inside Roche limit, tidal forces exceed satellite's self-gravity. Explains why Saturn's rings exist and why some moons are stable. Used to understand planetary ring systems.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Why do Saturn's rings exist?",
      "solution": "Rings are inside Roche limit - moon was torn apart by tidal forces",
      "steps": [
        "Moon orbited too close to Saturn",
        "Entered Roche limit",
        "Tidal forces exceeded moon's self-gravity",
        "Moon was torn apart, forming rings"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "Why doesn't Moon break apart?",
      "solution": "Moon is far enough from Earth to be outside Roche limit",
      "steps": [
        "Moon's distance > Earth's Roche limit",
        "Tidal forces < Moon's self-gravity",
        "Moon remains intact",
        "But tidal forces cause geological activity"
