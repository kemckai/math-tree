  "explanation": "Kepler's three laws describe planetary orbits: (1) Orbits are ellipses with Sun at one focus, (2) Equal areas swept in equal times (angular momentum conservation), (3) T\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3 where T is period and a is semi-major axis. These laws revolutionized astronomy, showing planets follow elliptical paths. Derived from Newton's laws, they explain orbital mechanics throughout the universe.",

      "steps": [
        "T\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3, so T\u00b2/T\u2081\u00b2 = (a/a\u2081)\u00b3",
        "T\u00b2/1\u00b2 = (1.52/1)\u00b3 = 3.51",

      "problem": "Why do planets move faster at perihelion?",
      "solution": "Conservation of angular momentum - closer to Sun means faster orbital speed",

        "Kepler's 2nd law: equal areas in equal times",
        "At perihelion: smaller distance from Sun",
        "Must move faster to sweep same area",

  "proof": "Kepler's laws derived from Newton's law of gravitation. Law 1 (elliptical orbits): Solution to F = GMm/r\u00b2 gives elliptical path. Law 2 (equal areas): Angular momentum L = mvr = constant, so dA/dt = \u00bdr\u00b2(d\u03b8/dt) = L/(2m) = constant. Law 3 (T\u00b2 \u221d a\u00b3): From F = ma and orbital mechanics, T\u00b2 = (4\u03c0\u00b2/GM)a\u00b3."
