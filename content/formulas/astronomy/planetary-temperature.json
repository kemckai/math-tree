  "latex": "T = \\left(\\frac{(1-A)L_\\odot}{16\\pi\\sigma d^2}\\right)^{1/4}",
  "explanation": "Equilibrium temperature is temperature planet reaches when incoming solar radiation equals outgoing thermal radiation. Depends on stellar luminosity (L), distance (d), and albedo (A - reflectivity). Used to determine habitable zones and understand planetary climates. Planets closer to star or with lower albedo are hotter.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Why is Venus so hot despite being farther from Sun than Mercury?",
      "solution": "Venus has very low albedo and thick atmosphere (greenhouse effect)",
      "steps": [
        "Venus albedo A ≈ 0.76 (very reflective clouds)",
        "But thick CO₂ atmosphere traps heat",
        "Greenhouse effect raises temperature far above equilibrium",
        "Surface temperature ~470°C (hotter than Mercury)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "What determines habitable zone?",
      "solution": "Distance range where equilibrium temperature allows liquid water",
      "steps": [
        "Too close: too hot, water boils",
        "Too far: too cold, water freezes",
        "Habitable zone: ~0.7-1.5 AU for Sun-like star",
        "Also depends on atmosphere and greenhouse effect"
