  "explanation": "CMB is remnant radiation from Big Bang, now cooled to 2.725 K. Peak wavelength ~1 mm (microwave). Provides snapshot of universe at 380,000 years old. Tiny temperature fluctuations (1 part in 100,000) reveal density variations that grew into galaxies. Strongest evidence for Big Bang theory.",

    {
      "problem": "Why is CMB so important?",
      "solution": "Direct evidence of Big Bang and seed of all structure",
      "steps": [
        "Oldest light in universe (380,000 years after Big Bang)",
        "Shows universe was hot, dense, uniform",
        "Tiny fluctuations = density variations",
        "These grew via gravity into galaxies and clusters"

      "problem": "Why is CMB temperature 2.7 K?",

      "steps": [
        "Big Bang: universe extremely hot",
        "Expansion: universe cooled",
        "After 13.8 billion years: T = 2.725 K",
