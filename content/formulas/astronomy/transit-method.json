  "explanation": "Transit method detects exoplanets when they pass in front of star, causing small brightness dip. Fractional brightness decrease equals (R_p/R_\u22c6)\u00b2. Used by Kepler and TESS missions to find thousands of exoplanets. Provides planet radius and orbital period. Combined with Doppler shift, gives planet mass and density.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Star dims by 1% during transit. Star radius is 1 solar radius. What is planet radius?",
      "solution": "0.1 solar radii (Jupiter-sized)",

  "proof": "\u0394F/F = (R_p/R_\u22c6)\u00b2. When planet transits, blocks area \u03c0R_p\u00b2 of star with area \u03c0R_\u22c6\u00b2. Fractional decrease in flux equals fractional decrease in area: \u0394F/F = (\u03c0R_p\u00b2)/(\u03c0R_\u22c6\u00b2) = (R_p/R_\u22c6)\u00b2. Larger planets cause bigger dips."
