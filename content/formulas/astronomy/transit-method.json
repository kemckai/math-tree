  "explanation": "Transit method detects exoplanets when they pass in front of star, causing small brightness dip. Fractional brightness decrease equals (R_p/R_⋆)². Used by Kepler and TESS missions to find thousands of exoplanets. Provides planet radius and orbital period. Combined with Doppler shift, gives planet mass and density.",

    {
      "problem": "Star dims by 1% during transit. Star radius is 1 solar radius. What is planet radius?",
      "solution": "0.1 solar radii (Jupiter-sized)",
      "steps": [
        "ΔF/F = (R_p/R_⋆)²",
        "0.01 = (R_p/R_⋆)²",
        "R_p/R_⋆ = √0.01 = 0.1",

      "problem": "Why is transit method so successful?",
      "solution": "Can detect many planets simultaneously and works for distant stars",

        "Monitors thousands of stars simultaneously",
        "Detects planets by brightness dips",
