  "explanation": "Schwarzschild radius is distance from black hole center where escape velocity equals light speed. Inside this radius (event horizon), nothing can escape, not even light. R_s = 2GM/c\u00b2. Determines black hole size. Used to understand black holes, gravitational collapse, and extreme gravity. Fundamental to general relativity.",

  "proof": "R_s = 2GM/c\u00b2. Derived from escape velocity: set v_escape = c. From v = \u221a(2GM/r), setting v = c gives: c = \u221a(2GM/R_s), so c\u00b2 = 2GM/R_s, therefore R_s = 2GM/c\u00b2. Inside this radius, escape velocity exceeds light speed."
