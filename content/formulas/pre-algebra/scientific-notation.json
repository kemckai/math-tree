  "explanation": "Scientific notation expresses numbers as a product of a number between 1 and 10 (the coefficient) and a power of 10. This is useful for very large or very small numbers. The exponent indicates how many places to move the decimal point: positive for large numbers (move right), negative for small numbers (move left).",
