  "explanation": "PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction) is the standard order for evaluating mathematical expressions. Operations inside parentheses are done first, followed by exponents. Multiplication and division are performed from left to right (they have equal precedence), then addition and subtraction from left to right. This ensures everyone evaluates expressions the same way.",
