  "explanation": "Wave speed equals frequency times wavelength (v = f\u03bb). Frequency (f) is cycles per second (Hz), wavelength (\u03bb) is distance between peaks, period (T) is time for one cycle. This fundamental relationship applies to all waves: sound, light, water waves, and electromagnetic waves. Essential for understanding wave behavior, interference, and resonance.",

  "proof": "v = f\u03bb. Proof: In one period T, wave travels distance \u03bb (one wavelength). Speed = distance/time = \u03bb/T. Since f = 1/T, we get v = \u03bbf = f\u03bb."
