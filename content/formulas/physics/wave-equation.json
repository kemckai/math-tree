  "explanation": "Wave speed equals frequency times wavelength (v = fλ). Frequency (f) is cycles per second (Hz), wavelength (λ) is distance between peaks, period (T) is time for one cycle. This fundamental relationship applies to all waves: sound, light, water waves, and electromagnetic waves. Essential for understanding wave behavior, interference, and resonance.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Sound wave has frequency 440 Hz and wavelength 0.78 m. What is speed?",
      "solution": "343 m/s",
      "steps": [
        "v = fλ",
        "v = 440 × 0.78 = 343.2 m/s ≈ 343 m/s"

      "problem": "Light has wavelength 500 nm. What is frequency? (c = 3×10⁸ m/s)",
      "solution": "6 × 10¹⁴ Hz",
      "steps": [
        "v = fλ, so f = v/λ",
        "f = (3×10⁸) / (500×10⁻⁹)",
        "f = 3×10⁸ / 5×10⁻⁷ = 6×10¹⁴ Hz"
