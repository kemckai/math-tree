  "name": "Magnetic Force on Moving Charge",
  "latex": "F = q\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}, \\quad F = qvB\\sin\\theta",
  "explanation": "A moving charge experiences a magnetic force perpendicular to both velocity and magnetic field. Force magnitude: F = qvB sin \u03b8, where \u03b8 is angle between v and B. Force direction given by right-hand rule. This explains how magnets work, particle accelerators, and electromagnetic devices. Magnetic force does no work (always perpendicular to motion).",
