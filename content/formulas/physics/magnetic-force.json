  "name": "Magnetic Force on Moving Charge",
  "latex": "F = q\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}, \\quad F = qvB\\sin\\theta",
  "explanation": "A moving charge experiences a magnetic force perpendicular to both velocity and magnetic field. Force magnitude: F = qvB sin θ, where θ is angle between v and B. Force direction given by right-hand rule. This explains how magnets work, particle accelerators, and electromagnetic devices. Magnetic force does no work (always perpendicular to motion).",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Electron (q = -1.6×10⁻¹⁹ C) moves at 10⁶ m/s perpendicular to 0.5T magnetic field. What is force?",
      "solution": "8 × 10⁻¹⁴ N",
      "steps": [
        "F = qvB sin θ",
        "θ = 90°, so sin 90° = 1",
        "F = (1.6×10⁻¹⁹) × (10⁶) × 0.5 × 1",
        "F = 8 × 10⁻¹⁴ N"

      "problem": "Why does magnetic force cause circular motion?",
      "solution": "Force is always perpendicular to velocity, changing direction but not speed",
      "steps": [
        "Magnetic force: F = q(v × B)",
        "Force ⊥ velocity (cross product)",
        "Changes direction, not magnitude of velocity",
        "Results in circular (or helical) motion"
