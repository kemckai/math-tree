  "latex": "n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2",
  "explanation": "Snell's law describes how light bends (refracts) when passing between media with different indices of refraction. n\u2081sin \u03b8\u2081 = n\u2082sin \u03b8\u2082, where n is refractive index and \u03b8 is angle from normal. Light bends toward normal when entering denser medium (higher n). Explains lenses, prisms, mirages, and optical phenomena. Essential for optics and understanding how light behaves.",

    {
      "problem": "Light enters water (n = 1.33) from air (n = 1) at 30\u00b0 angle. What is refracted angle?",

      "steps": [
        "n\u2081sin \u03b8\u2081 = n\u2082sin \u03b8\u2082",

      "problem": "Why does light bend when entering water?",
      "solution": "Light slows down in denser medium, causing refraction",
      "steps": [
        "Refractive index n = c/v (speed ratio)",
        "Higher n = slower speed in medium",
        "Wavefront bends at interface",
        "Results in change in direction"

  "topic": "physics",
  "proof": "Snell's law follows from Fermat's principle (light takes path of least time) or Huygens' principle (wavefronts). At interface, wave speed changes, causing wavefront to bend. n\u2081sin(\u03b8\u2081) = n\u2082sin(\u03b8\u2082) ensures path minimizes time, where n = c/v is refractive index."
