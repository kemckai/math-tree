  "latex": "n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2",
  "explanation": "Snell's law describes how light bends (refracts) when passing between media with different indices of refraction. n₁sin θ₁ = n₂sin θ₂, where n is refractive index and θ is angle from normal. Light bends toward normal when entering denser medium (higher n). Explains lenses, prisms, mirages, and optical phenomena. Essential for optics and understanding how light behaves.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Light enters water (n = 1.33) from air (n = 1) at 30° angle. What is refracted angle?",
      "solution": "22.1°",
      "steps": [
        "n₁sin θ₁ = n₂sin θ₂",
        "1 × sin 30° = 1.33 × sin θ₂",
        "0.5 = 1.33 sin θ₂",
        "sin θ₂ = 0.376, θ₂ = 22.1°"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "Why does light bend when entering water?",
      "solution": "Light slows down in denser medium, causing refraction",
      "steps": [
        "Refractive index n = c/v (speed ratio)",
        "Higher n = slower speed in medium",
        "Wavefront bends at interface",
        "Results in change in direction"
