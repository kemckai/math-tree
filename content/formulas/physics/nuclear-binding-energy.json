  "latex": "E_{binding} = \\Delta m c^2, \\quad \\Delta m = Zm_p + Nm_n - m_{nucleus}",
  "explanation": "Binding energy is the energy holding nucleus together. Mass defect (Δm) is difference between sum of individual nucleon masses and actual nucleus mass. Binding energy E = Δmc². Larger binding energy per nucleon = more stable nucleus. Peak stability around iron (Fe). Nuclear reactions release energy when moving toward more stable nuclei (fusion or fission).",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Why does nuclear fusion release energy?",
      "solution": "Product nuclei have higher binding energy per nucleon",
      "steps": [
        "Light nuclei (H, He) have low binding energy",
        "Fusing creates heavier, more stable nuclei",
        "Mass defect converted to energy (E = mc²)",
        "Sun fuses H → He, releasing energy"
      ]

    {
      "problem": "Why does fission of heavy nuclei release energy?",
      "solution": "Splitting heavy nuclei creates products closer to iron (peak stability)",
      "steps": [
        "Heavy nuclei (U, Pu) are less stable",
        "Fission products are closer to iron",
        "Higher binding energy per nucleon in products",
        "Mass defect released as energy"
