  "latex": "\\mathbf{p} = m\\mathbf{v}, \\quad \\sum \\mathbf{p}_{before} = \\sum \\mathbf{p}_{after}",
  "explanation": "Momentum is conserved in isolated systems (no external forces). Momentum p = mv (mass times velocity). In collisions, total momentum before equals total momentum after. This principle explains collisions, explosions, and rocket propulsion. Used in analyzing impacts, particle interactions, and any system where objects interact. Essential for understanding dynamics and collisions.",

  "proof": "Momentum conservation follows from Newton's third law: F\u2081\u2082 = -F\u2082\u2081. For two particles: dp\u2081/dt = F\u2081\u2082, dp\u2082/dt = F\u2082\u2081. Adding: d(p\u2081 + p\u2082)/dt = F\u2081\u2082 + F\u2082\u2081 = 0. Therefore p\u2081 + p\u2082 = constant. This extends to systems with no external forces."
