  "explanation": "Kinematic equations describe motion with constant acceleration. v = v₀ + at (final velocity), x = v₀t + ½at² (displacement), v² = v₀² + 2ax (velocity-displacement relation). These fundamental equations govern all motion under constant acceleration, from falling objects to projectiles. Essential for understanding motion in one and two dimensions.",

      "problem": "A ball is dropped from rest. After 3 seconds, what is its velocity? (g = 9.8 m/s²)",
      "solution": "29.4 m/s downward",
      "steps": [
        "v = v₀ + at",
