  "explanation": "Kinematic equations describe motion with constant acceleration. v = v\u2080 + at (final velocity), x = v\u2080t + \u00bdat\u00b2 (displacement), v\u00b2 = v\u2080\u00b2 + 2ax (velocity-displacement relation). These fundamental equations govern all motion under constant acceleration, from falling objects to projectiles. Essential for understanding motion in one and two dimensions.",

  "proof": "Derived from constant acceleration. Starting with a = constant, integrate: v = \u222ba dt = at + v\u2080. Integrate again: x = \u222bv dt = \u222b(at + v\u2080)dt = \u00bdat\u00b2 + v\u2080t + x\u2080. For v\u00b2 = v\u2080\u00b2 + 2ax, eliminate t from v = v\u2080 + at and x = v\u2080t + \u00bdat\u00b2, giving v\u00b2 = v\u2080\u00b2 + 2ax."
