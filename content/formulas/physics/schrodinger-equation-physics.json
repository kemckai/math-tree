  "explanation": "Schrödinger's equation is the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, describing how quantum states evolve. The wavefunction ψ contains all information about a quantum system. Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator (total energy). This equation revolutionized physics, explaining atomic structure, chemical bonding, and quantum phenomena. Predicts probabilities, not certainties - fundamental to quantum mechanics.",

      "problem": "What does the wavefunction represent?",
