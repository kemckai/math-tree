  "explanation": "Schr\u00f6dinger's equation is the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, describing how quantum states evolve. The wavefunction \u03c8 contains all information about a quantum system. \u0124 is the Hamiltonian operator (total energy). This equation revolutionized physics, explaining atomic structure, chemical bonding, and quantum phenomena. Predicts probabilities, not certainties - fundamental to quantum mechanics.",

  "proof": "Schr\u00f6dinger equation: i\u210f\u2202\u03c8/\u2202t = \u0124\u03c8. Derived from energy conservation: E = KE + PE. In quantum mechanics, E \u2192 i\u210f\u2202/\u2202t, p \u2192 -i\u210f\u2207, so \u0124 = -\u210f\u00b2/(2m)\u2207\u00b2 + V. This gives time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. For stationary states: \u0124\u03c8 = E\u03c8 (time-independent form)."
