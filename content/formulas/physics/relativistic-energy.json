  "explanation": "Relativistic energy accounts for effects at high speeds. Total energy E = γmc² where γ is Lorentz factor. At rest: E = mc² (Einstein's famous equation). Full equation: E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². As speed approaches light speed, energy approaches infinity. Explains why nothing can exceed light speed and how mass and energy are equivalent.",
