  "latex": "E = \\gamma mc^2, \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}, \\quad E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2",
  "explanation": "Relativistic energy accounts for effects at high speeds. Total energy E = \u03b3mc\u00b2 where \u03b3 is Lorentz factor. At rest: E = mc\u00b2 (Einstein's famous equation). Full equation: E\u00b2 = (pc)\u00b2 + (mc\u00b2)\u00b2. As speed approaches light speed, energy approaches infinity. Explains why nothing can exceed light speed and how mass and energy are equivalent.",
