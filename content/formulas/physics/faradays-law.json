  "latex": "\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}, \\quad \\Phi_B = BA\\cos\\theta",
  "explanation": "Faraday's law: changing magnetic flux induces electromotive force (EMF). EMF = -dΦ_B/dt where Φ_B is magnetic flux. Flux Φ_B = BA cos θ (B = field, A = area, θ = angle). Negative sign (Lenz's law) means induced current opposes change. This explains generators, transformers, and electromagnetic induction. Fundamental to electricity generation.",
