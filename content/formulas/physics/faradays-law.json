  "explanation": "Faraday's law: changing magnetic flux induces electromotive force (EMF). EMF = -d\u03a6_B/dt where \u03a6_B is magnetic flux. Flux \u03a6_B = BA cos \u03b8 (B = field, A = area, \u03b8 = angle). Negative sign (Lenz's law) means induced current opposes change. This explains generators, transformers, and electromagnetic induction. Fundamental to electricity generation.",

  "proof": "Faraday's law: EMF = -d\u03a6/dt. Proof: Moving conductor in magnetic field experiences force F = q(v \u00d7 B) on charges. Work done moving charge: W = F\u00b7d = q(v \u00d7 B)\u00b7d. EMF = W/q = (v \u00d7 B)\u00b7d. For changing flux: EMF = -d(BA)/dt = -d\u03a6/dt. Negative sign from Lenz's law (induced current opposes change)."
