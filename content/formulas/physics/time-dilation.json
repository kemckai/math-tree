  "latex": "\\Delta t = \\gamma\\Delta t_0, \\quad \\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}",
  "explanation": "Time dilation: moving clocks run slower. Time interval in moving frame (\u0394t) equals proper time (\u0394t\u2080) times Lorentz factor \u03b3. This is a real effect, not an illusion - confirmed by experiments with atomic clocks and particle accelerators. Explains why muons reach Earth's surface (they live longer in our frame). Fundamental to special relativity.",

        "\u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1 - 0.99\u00b2) = 1/\u221a(1 - 0.9801) = 1/\u221a0.0199 = 7.09",

      "problem": "Why do GPS satellites need relativity corrections?",

  "proof": "\u0394t = \u03b3\u0394t\u2080 where \u03b3 = 1/\u221a(1-v\u00b2/c\u00b2). Derived from Lorentz transformations. Light clock: photon bouncing between mirrors. In moving frame, path is longer (hypotenuse), so time runs slower. Confirmed by experiments with atomic clocks and muons."
