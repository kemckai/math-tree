  "explanation": "Time dilation: moving clocks run slower. Time interval in moving frame (Δt) equals proper time (Δt₀) times Lorentz factor γ. This is a real effect, not an illusion - confirmed by experiments with atomic clocks and particle accelerators. Explains why muons reach Earth's surface (they live longer in our frame). Fundamental to special relativity.",

      "problem": "Muon lifetime is 2.2μs in rest frame. If moving at 0.99c, what is lifetime in lab frame?",
      "solution": "15.6 μs",
      "steps": [
        "γ = 1/√(1 - 0.99²) = 1/√(1 - 0.9801) = 1/√0.0199 = 7.09",
        "Δt = γΔt₀ = 7.09 × 2.2 = 15.6 μs"

      "problem": "Why do GPS satellites need relativity corrections?",
      "solution": "Time runs faster in weaker gravity, slower due to orbital speed",
      "steps": [
        "General relativity: time runs faster at higher altitude",
        "Special relativity: time runs slower due to speed",
        "Net effect: GPS clocks run faster",
