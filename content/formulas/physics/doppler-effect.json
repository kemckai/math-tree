  "latex": "f' = f\\frac{v \\pm v_o}{v \\mp v_s}",
  "explanation": "Doppler effect is the change in frequency when source and observer move relative to each other. Moving toward each other: frequency increases (blue shift). Moving apart: frequency decreases (red shift). Used in radar, medical ultrasound, astronomy (measuring star speeds), and understanding wave behavior. Explains why sirens sound different when approaching vs. receding.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Ambulance (500 Hz) approaches at 30 m/s. Observer stationary. What frequency? (v_sound = 343 m/s)",
      "solution": "544 Hz",
      "steps": [
        "f' = f × v/(v - v_s) (source moving toward observer)",
        "f' = 500 × 343/(343 - 30)",
        "f' = 500 × 343/313 = 544 Hz"

      "problem": "After passing, what frequency?",
      "solution": "464 Hz",
      "steps": [
        "f' = f × v/(v + v_s) (source moving away)",
