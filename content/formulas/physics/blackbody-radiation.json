  "explanation": "Blackbody is a perfect absorber/emitter of radiation. Wien's law: peak wavelength λ_max = b/T (b = Wien's constant). Hotter objects emit shorter wavelengths (bluer). Planck's law: E = hf (energy of photon). This explains why hot objects glow (red → yellow → white → blue as temperature increases). Fundamental to understanding thermal radiation, stars, and quantum mechanics.",
