  "latex": "\\Delta S = \\frac{Q}{T}, \\quad S = k_B \\ln W",
  "explanation": "Entropy (S) measures disorder or randomness. Second law: entropy of isolated system always increases. ΔS = Q/T for reversible processes. Boltzmann: S = k_B ln W (W = number of microstates). Entropy explains why processes are irreversible, why heat flows from hot to cold, and the arrow of time. Fundamental to understanding thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.",
