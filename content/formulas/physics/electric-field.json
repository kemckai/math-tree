  "explanation": "Electric field (E) is force per unit charge, measured in N/C or V/m. Represents the force a charge would experience at a point. For a point charge Q: E = kQ/r². Electric fields explain how charges interact at a distance. Used in understanding capacitors, circuits, and electromagnetic phenomena. Field lines show direction and strength of electric field.",

      "problem": "A 5μC charge creates an electric field. What is field strength 0.2m away?",
      "solution": "1.12 × 10⁶ N/C",
      "steps": [
        "E = kQ/r²",
        "E = (8.99×10⁹) × (5×10⁻⁶) / (0.2)²",
