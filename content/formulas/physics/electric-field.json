  "explanation": "Electric field (E) is force per unit charge, measured in N/C or V/m. Represents the force a charge would experience at a point. For a point charge Q: E = kQ/r\u00b2. Electric fields explain how charges interact at a distance. Used in understanding capacitors, circuits, and electromagnetic phenomena. Field lines show direction and strength of electric field.",

        "E = F/q",

  "proof": "E = F/q = kQ/r\u00b2. Defined as force per unit charge. For point charge Q, field strength E = kQ/r\u00b2 follows from Coulomb's law F = kQq/r\u00b2 divided by test charge q. Field lines show direction and strength. Superposition: Total field is vector sum of individual fields."
