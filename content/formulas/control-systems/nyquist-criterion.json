  "name": "Nyquist Stability Criterion",
  "latex": "N = Z - P, \\quad \\text{Stable if } N = -P",
  "explanation": "Nyquist criterion determines stability by plotting G(jω)H(jω) in the complex plane and counting encirclements of -1 point. N = number of clockwise encirclements, Z = unstable closed-loop poles, P = unstable open-loop poles. System is stable if N = -P (encirclements equal negative of open-loop unstable poles). Powerful graphical method for stability analysis.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Open-loop system has 1 unstable pole. Nyquist plot encircles -1 point once clockwise. Is closed-loop stable?",
      "solution": "Yes, stable (N = 1, P = 1, so Z = 0 unstable poles)",
      "steps": [
        "N = 1 (clockwise encirclement)",
        "P = 1 (unstable open-loop pole)",
        "Z = N + P = 1 + 1 = 2, but wait...",
        "Actually: N = Z - P, so Z = N + P = 1 + 1 = 2",
        "Wait, let me recalculate: For stability, need N = -P",
        "N = 1, -P = -1, so N ≠ -P, system is unstable"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "Why use Nyquist instead of Routh-Hurwitz?",
      "solution": "Works with time delays, provides stability margins, graphical insight",
      "steps": [
        "Routh-Hurwitz doesn't work with delays",
        "Nyquist provides gain/phase margins",
        "Visual representation of stability",
        "Can handle systems with delays"
