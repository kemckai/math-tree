  "latex": "PM = 180° + \\angle G(j\\omega_c), \\quad GM = -20\\log_{10}|G(j\\omega_p)|",
  "explanation": "Stability margins measure how close a system is to instability. Phase margin (PM) is 180° plus phase at crossover frequency (where gain = 1). Gain margin (GM) is negative gain in dB at phase crossover (where phase = -180°). Larger margins = more stable. Typical design: PM > 45°, GM > 6 dB. These margins ensure robustness to uncertainties and disturbances.",

      "steps": [

        "GM = -20log₁₀|G|",
