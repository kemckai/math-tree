  "latex": "\\text{System stable if all coefficients in Routh table first column are positive}",
  "explanation": "The Routh-Hurwitz criterion determines system stability without finding roots. Construct a Routh table from the characteristic equation coefficients. System is stable if all elements in the first column are positive. If any are negative or zero, system is unstable. This is a powerful algebraic method for stability analysis without solving for poles.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Characteristic equation: s³ + 3s² + 2s + 1 = 0. Is system stable?",
      "solution": "Yes, all first column elements positive",
      "steps": [
        "Routh table:",
        "Row 1: 1, 2",
        "Row 2: 3, 1",
        "Row 3: (3×2 - 1×1)/3 = 5/3",
        "Row 4: 1",
        "First column: [1, 3, 5/3, 1] - all positive, stable"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "Why use Routh-Hurwitz instead of finding roots?",
      "solution": "Faster, no need to solve polynomial, works for high-order systems",
      "steps": [
        "Finding roots of high-order polynomials is difficult",
        "Routh table is simple arithmetic",
        "Can determine stability quickly",
        "Useful for controller design"
