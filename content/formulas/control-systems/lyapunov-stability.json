  "explanation": "Lyapunov's method proves stability by finding a positive definite function V(x) (Lyapunov function) whose derivative is negative definite. If such a function exists, the system is stable. Works for nonlinear systems and doesn't require solving differential equations. Powerful method for proving stability of complex systems, including nonlinear and time-varying systems.",
