  "latex": "G_c(s) = K\\frac{s + z}{s + p}, \\quad \\text{Lead: } z < p, \\quad \\text{Lag: } z > p",
  "explanation": "Compensators improve system performance. Lead compensator (z < p) increases phase margin, improves transient response, speeds up system. Lag compensator (z > p) improves steady-state accuracy, reduces steady-state error. Used when simple PID tuning isn't sufficient. Lead-lag combines both effects. Essential for advanced control system design.",

    {
      "problem": "Lead compensator: G_c(s) = (s + 1)/(s + 10). What does it do?",
      "solution": "Increases phase margin, speeds up response",
      "steps": [
        "z = 1, p = 10, so z < p (lead)",
        "Adds positive phase (phase lead)",
        "Increases bandwidth (faster response)",
