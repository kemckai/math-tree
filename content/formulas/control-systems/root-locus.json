  "explanation": "Root locus plots how closed-loop poles move in the complex plane as gain K varies from 0 to ∞. Shows how system stability and response change with controller gain. Poles in left half-plane = stable, right half-plane = unstable. Used to design controllers by choosing appropriate gain values. Provides insight into system behavior and helps tune PID controllers.",
