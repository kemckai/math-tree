  "latex": "G(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} = \\frac{\\text{Output}}{\\text{Input}}",
  "explanation": "Transfer functions describe system behavior in the frequency domain (Laplace domain). G(s) = Y(s)/X(s) where s is the complex frequency variable. Represents how a system responds to inputs. Used to analyze stability, design controllers, and predict system response. Transfer functions enable powerful mathematical analysis of dynamic systems using algebra instead of differential equations.",
