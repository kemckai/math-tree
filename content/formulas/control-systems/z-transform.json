  "explanation": "Z-transform is the discrete-time equivalent of Laplace transform. Used for analyzing digital control systems and discrete-time signals. z = e^(sT) where T is sampling period. Enables analysis of digital filters, discrete controllers, and sampled-data systems. Essential for digital control system design, where continuous signals are sampled and processed digitally.",
