  "explanation": "Closed-loop systems use feedback to control output. T(s) is the overall system transfer function where G(s) is the plant (system being controlled) and H(s) is the feedback path. The denominator 1 + G(s)H(s) determines stability. Feedback reduces sensitivity to disturbances and improves accuracy. Most control systems use closed-loop feedback for better performance.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Plant G(s) = 10/s, feedback H(s) = 1. What is closed-loop transfer function?",
      "solution": "T(s) = 10/(s + 10)",
      "steps": [
        "T(s) = G(s) / (1 + G(s)H(s))",
        "T(s) = (10/s) / (1 + 10/s × 1)",
        "T(s) = (10/s) / ((s + 10)/s)",

      "problem": "Why is closed-loop better than open-loop?",
      "solution": "Feedback compensates for disturbances and model errors",
      "steps": [
        "Open-loop: no feedback, errors accumulate",
        "Closed-loop: measures output, corrects errors",
