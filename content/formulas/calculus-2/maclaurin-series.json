  "explanation": "A Maclaurin series is a special case of a Taylor series centered at 0. It represents a function as an infinite sum using the function's derivatives evaluated at 0. Many common functions have well-known Maclaurin series expansions, such as e^x, sin(x), cos(x), and 1/(1-x). These series are fundamental in calculus and mathematical analysis.",

  "proof": "Maclaurin series is Taylor series centered at a=0: f(x) = \u03a3[n=0 to \u221e] f^(n)(0)/n! x^n. Special cases: e^x = \u03a3 x^n/n!, sin(x) = \u03a3 (-1)^n x^(2n+1)/(2n+1)!, cos(x) = \u03a3 (-1)^n x^(2n)/(2n)!. Derived from Taylor series with a=0."
