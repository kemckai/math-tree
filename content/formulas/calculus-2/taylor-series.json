  "explanation": "A Taylor series represents a function as an infinite sum of terms calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point. The series uses the function's value and all its derivatives at point a. When a = 0, it's called a Maclaurin series. Taylor series are powerful tools for approximating functions and solving differential equations.",

  "proof": "Taylor series: f(x) = \u03a3[n=0 to \u221e] f^(n)(a)/n! (x-a)^n. Proof: Assume f(x) = \u03a3 c_n (x-a)^n. Differentiate term by term: f'(x) = \u03a3 n c_n (x-a)^(n-1). At x=a: f(a) = c\u2080, f'(a) = c\u2081, f''(a) = 2c\u2082, ..., f^(n)(a) = n! c_n. Therefore c_n = f^(n)(a)/n!."
