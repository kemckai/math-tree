  "explanation": "A Taylor series represents a function as an infinite sum of terms calculated from the function's derivatives at a single point. The series uses the function's value and all its derivatives at point a. When a = 0, it's called a Maclaurin series. Taylor series are powerful tools for approximating functions and solving differential equations.",
