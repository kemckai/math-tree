  "explanation": "Partial fraction decomposition breaks down rational functions (fractions with polynomials) into simpler fractions that are easier to integrate. This technique is essential for integrating rational functions. The method involves expressing the fraction as a sum of simpler fractions with unknown coefficients, then solving for those coefficients.",

  "proof": "Any rational function P(x)/Q(x) can be decomposed into sum of simpler fractions. If Q(x) factors as (x-r\u2081)(x-r\u2082)..., then P(x)/Q(x) = A\u2081/(x-r\u2081) + A\u2082/(x-r\u2082) + ... Multiply both sides by Q(x) and solve for constants A_i by substituting values of x."
