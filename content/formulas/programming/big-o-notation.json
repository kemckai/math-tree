  "latex": "O(1), O(\\log n), O(n), O(n \\log n), O(n^2), O(2^n)",
  "explanation": "Big O notation describes how algorithm runtime or space requirements grow with input size. O(1) = constant time (fastest), O(log n) = logarithmic (very fast), O(n) = linear, O(n log n) = linearithmic, O(n\u00b2) = quadratic (slow), O(2\u207f) = exponential (very slow). This is essential for choosing efficient algorithms and understanding performance trade-offs. Understanding complexity helps write scalable code.",
