  "latex": "\\text{Latency} = \\text{Context Switch Time} + \\text{ISR Execution Time}",
  "explanation": "Interrupt latency is the time from interrupt request to interrupt service routine (ISR) execution. Critical for real-time systems where timely response is essential. Latency includes: interrupt recognition, context saving, ISR execution, and context restoration. Minimizing latency is crucial for embedded systems, robotics, and safety-critical applications. Lower latency enables faster response to external events.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Interrupt recognized in 2μs, context save 1μs, ISR 5μs, context restore 1μs. What is latency?",
      "solution": "9μs",
      "steps": [
        "Latency = recognition + save + ISR + restore",
        "Latency = 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 9μs"
      ]

    {
      "problem": "Why is low interrupt latency important?",
      "solution": "Enables real-time response to critical events",
      "steps": [
        "Safety systems need immediate response",
        "Motor control requires precise timing",
        "Communication protocols have timing constraints",
        "Low latency ensures system meets deadlines"
