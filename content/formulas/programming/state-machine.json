  "explanation": "Finite State Machines model systems with discrete states and transitions. System is in one state at a time, transitions occur based on inputs. Used in embedded systems, protocol design, and control systems. Essential for managing complex behavior with clear logic. States represent system modes, transitions represent events. Used in traffic lights, vending machines, and communication protocols.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Traffic light FSM: Red → (timer) → Green → (timer) → Yellow → (timer) → Red",
      "solution": "3 states, 3 transitions forming a cycle",
      "steps": [
        "State 1: Red (wait for timer)",
        "Transition: timer expires → State 2: Green",

      "problem": "Why use state machines in embedded systems?",

        "Each state has well-defined behavior",
        "Transitions are explicit and testable",
        "Easier to reason about system behavior",
