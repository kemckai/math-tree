  "explanation": "Memory management is crucial in programming. Stack memory: automatic, fast, limited size, LIFO order. Heap memory: dynamic allocation, larger size, manual management (malloc/free, new/delete). Stack stores local variables and function calls. Heap stores dynamically allocated data. Understanding memory is essential for efficient programs and avoiding memory leaks. Critical in embedded systems with limited RAM.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Why is stack faster than heap?",
      "solution": "Stack uses simple pointer increment/decrement, heap requires complex allocation algorithms",
      "steps": [
        "Stack: just move stack pointer up/down",
        "Heap: must find free block, manage fragmentation",
        "Stack: O(1) allocation/deallocation",
        "Heap: O(log n) or O(n) depending on allocator"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "When to use stack vs heap?",
      "solution": "Stack for small, short-lived data. Heap for large or long-lived data.",
      "steps": [
        "Stack: local variables, function parameters",
        "Heap: arrays of unknown size, data structures",
        "Embedded systems: prefer stack (limited heap)",
        "Desktop apps: heap for flexibility"
