  "explanation": "Graphs represent relationships between entities. BFS (Breadth-First Search) explores level by level using a queue, finds shortest paths in unweighted graphs. DFS (Depth-First Search) explores as deep as possible using recursion/stack, useful for pathfinding and cycle detection. Both have O(V + E) time complexity where V = vertices, E = edges. Used in social networks, routing, and dependency resolution.",
