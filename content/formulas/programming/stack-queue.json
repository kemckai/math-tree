  "explanation": "Stacks and queues are fundamental linear data structures. Stack: push (add top), pop (remove top) - LIFO order. Queue: enqueue (add rear), dequeue (remove front) - FIFO order. Both have O(1) operations. Stacks used for function calls, expression evaluation, undo operations. Queues used for task scheduling, BFS, and buffering. Essential for many algorithms and system design.",
