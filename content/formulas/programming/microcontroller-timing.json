  "explanation": "Microcontrollers execute instructions at a fixed clock frequency. Timing calculations are essential for delays, PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), and real-time systems. Delay time = clock cycles / frequency. PWM duty cycle = (ON time / total period) × 100%. Used in embedded systems for motor control, LED dimming, and precise timing. Understanding timing is critical for real-time applications.",
