  "explanation": "Recursion solves problems by calling the function on smaller instances. Requires: base case (stopping condition) and recursive case (calls itself with smaller input). Used for tree traversal, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and problems with recursive structure. Can be elegant but may be inefficient without memoization. Understanding recursion is essential for advanced algorithms.",
