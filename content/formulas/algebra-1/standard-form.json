  "name": "Standard Form of a Line",
  "latex": "Ax + By = C",
  "explanation": "The standard form of a linear equation is Ax + By = C, where A, B, and C are integers, and A is typically non-negative. This form is useful for finding x and y intercepts easily: set y=0 to find x-intercept (C/A) and set x=0 to find y-intercept (C/B). It's also the preferred form for systems of equations.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Convert y = 2x + 3 to standard form",
      "solution": "2x - y = -3",
      "steps": [
        "Start with: y = 2x + 3",
        "Subtract 2x from both sides: -2x + y = 3",
        "Multiply by -1 to make A positive: 2x - y = -3"

      "problem": "Find the x and y intercepts of 3x + 4y = 12",
      "solution": "x-intercept: (4, 0), y-intercept: (0, 3)",
      "steps": [
        "For x-intercept, set y = 0:",
        "3x + 4(0) = 12",
        "3x = 12, so x = 4",
        "For y-intercept, set x = 0:",
        "3(0) + 4y = 12",
        "4y = 12, so y = 3"
