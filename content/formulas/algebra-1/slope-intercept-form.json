  "latex": "y = mx + b",
  "explanation": "The slope-intercept form is a linear equation where m represents the slope (rate of change) and b represents the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis). The slope tells us how steep the line is: positive slopes go up from left to right, negative slopes go down. This form makes it easy to graph lines and understand their behavior.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Graph the line y = 2x + 3",
      "solution": "Line with slope 2, y-intercept at (0, 3)",
      "steps": [
        "Identify: m = 2 (slope), b = 3 (y-intercept)",
        "Plot the y-intercept: (0, 3)",
        "Use slope: rise/run = 2/1, so from (0,3), go up 2, right 1 to (1,5)",
        "Draw the line through these points"
