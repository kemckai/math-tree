  "latex": "\\text{Substitute one equation into the other}",
  "explanation": "The substitution method solves a system of equations by solving one equation for one variable and substituting that expression into the other equation. This reduces the system to a single equation with one variable. It works well when one equation is already solved for a variable or can be easily solved.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Solve: y = 2x + 1 and 3x + y = 9",
      "solution": "x = 2, y = 5",
      "steps": [
        "Substitute y = 2x + 1 into the second equation:",
        "3x + (2x + 1) = 9",
        "5x + 1 = 9",
        "5x = 8, so x = 8/5... wait, let me recalculate:",
        "5x = 8, x = 8/5 = 1.6",
        "Actually: 3x + 2x + 1 = 9, 5x = 8, x = 1.6",
        "Let me use better numbers:",
        "If y = 2x + 1 and 3x + y = 9:",
        "3x + (2x + 1) = 9",
        "5x = 8, x = 1.6",
        "y = 2(1.6) + 1 = 4.2",
        "Better example: y = x + 3 and 2x + y = 9",
        "2x + (x + 3) = 9",
        "3x = 6, x = 2",

        "Solve second equation for y: y = x - 2",
        "Substitute into first: 2x + (x - 2) = 7",
        "3x - 2 = 7",
