  "explanation": "Factoring is the process of writing a polynomial as a product of simpler polynomials. For quadratics, we look for two numbers that add to the coefficient of x and multiply to the constant term. Factoring is useful for solving equations, as if (x + p)(x + q) = 0, then x = -p or x = -q.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Factor x² + 7x + 12",
      "solution": "(x + 3)(x + 4)",
      "steps": [
        "Find two numbers that add to 7 and multiply to 12:",
        "3 + 4 = 7 and 3 × 4 = 12",
        "So: x² + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)"

      "steps": [
        "Find two numbers that add to -5 and multiply to 6:",
        "-2 + (-3) = -5 and (-2)(-3) = 6",
        "So: x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)"

      "problem": "Solve x² - 9 = 0 by factoring",
      "solution": "x = 3 or x = -3",
      "steps": [
        "This is a difference of squares: x² - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)",
        "Set equal to zero: (x - 3)(x + 3) = 0",
        "So x - 3 = 0 or x + 3 = 0",
        "Therefore: x = 3 or x = -3"
