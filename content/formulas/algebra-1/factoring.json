  "explanation": "Factoring is the process of writing a polynomial as a product of simpler polynomials. For quadratics, we look for two numbers that add to the coefficient of x and multiply to the constant term. Factoring is useful for solving equations, as if (x + p)(x + q) = 0, then x = -p or x = -q.",

      "problem": "Factor x\u00b2 + 7x + 12",
      "solution": "(x + 3)(x + 4)",
      "steps": [
        "Find two numbers that add to 7 and multiply to 12:",
        "3 + 4 = 7 and 3 \u00d7 4 = 12",
        "So: x\u00b2 + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)"

        "Find two numbers that add to -5 and multiply to 6:",

      "solution": "x = 3 or x = -3",
      "steps": [
        "This is a difference of squares: x\u00b2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3)",
        "Set equal to zero: (x - 3)(x + 3) = 0",
        "So x - 3 = 0 or x + 3 = 0",
        "Therefore: x = 3 or x = -3"

  "proof": "Factoring reverses multiplication. For ax\u00b2 + bx + c, find two numbers p and q such that p + q = b and pq = ac. Then factor as (ax + p)(ax + q)/a. This works because (ax + p)(ax + q) = a\u00b2x\u00b2 + a(p+q)x + pq = a\u00b2x\u00b2 + abx + ac, dividing by a gives original."
