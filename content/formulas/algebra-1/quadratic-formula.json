  "explanation": "The quadratic formula solves any quadratic equation of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. The \u00b1 symbol means there are typically two solutions. The expression under the square root (b\u00b2 - 4ac) is called the discriminant. If it's positive, there are two real solutions; if zero, one solution; if negative, two complex solutions.",

  "proof": "Start with ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. Divide by a: x\u00b2 + (b/a)x + c/a = 0. Complete the square: x\u00b2 + (b/a)x = -c/a. Add (b/2a)\u00b2 to both sides: x\u00b2 + (b/a)x + (b/2a)\u00b2 = -c/a + (b/2a)\u00b2. Left side is (x + b/2a)\u00b2. Right side: -c/a + b\u00b2/4a\u00b2 = (-4ac + b\u00b2)/4a\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 - 4ac)/4a\u00b2. Take square root: x + b/2a = \u00b1\u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)/2a. Solve for x: x = -b/2a \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)/2a = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac))/2a."
