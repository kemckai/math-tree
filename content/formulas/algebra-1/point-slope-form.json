  "latex": "y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)",
  "explanation": "The point-slope form of a linear equation uses a known point (x₁, y₁) and the slope m to write the equation. This form is particularly useful when you know one point on the line and the slope, but not the y-intercept. It's easy to convert to slope-intercept form by solving for y.",

      "problem": "Write the equation of a line with slope 3 that passes through point (2, 5)",

        "Given: m = 3, point (2, 5)",
        "Substitute into point-slope form:",
        "y - 5 = 3(x - 2)",
