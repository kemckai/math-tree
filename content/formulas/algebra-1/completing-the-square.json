  "latex": "x^2 + bx + c = (x + \\frac{b}{2})^2 - (\\frac{b}{2})^2 + c",
  "explanation": "Completing the square is a method for solving quadratic equations by rewriting them in the form (x + h)\u00b2 = k. This technique is useful for deriving the quadratic formula and for solving equations that don't factor easily. The key is to add and subtract (b/2)\u00b2 to create a perfect square trinomial.",

  "proof": "To solve ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, complete square: ax\u00b2 + bx = -c, divide by a: x\u00b2 + (b/a)x = -c/a. Add (b/2a)\u00b2: x\u00b2 + (b/a)x + (b/2a)\u00b2 = -c/a + (b/2a)\u00b2. Left side is perfect square: (x + b/2a)\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 - 4ac)/4a\u00b2. Take square root and solve for x."
