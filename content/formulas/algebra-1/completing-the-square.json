  "latex": "x^2 + bx + c = (x + \\frac{b}{2})^2 - (\\frac{b}{2})^2 + c",
  "explanation": "Completing the square is a method for solving quadratic equations by rewriting them in the form (x + h)² = k. This technique is useful for deriving the quadratic formula and for solving equations that don't factor easily. The key is to add and subtract (b/2)² to create a perfect square trinomial.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Solve x² + 6x + 5 = 0 by completing the square",
      "solution": "x = -1 or x = -5",
      "steps": [
        "Start: x² + 6x + 5 = 0",
        "Move constant: x² + 6x = -5",
        "Add (6/2)² = 9 to both sides: x² + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9",
        "Factor left side: (x + 3)² = 4",
        "Take square root: x + 3 = ±2",
