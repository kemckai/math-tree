  "latex": "Re = \\frac{\\rho vD}{\\mu} = \\frac{vD}{\\nu}",
  "explanation": "Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless parameter that predicts flow regime. Re = ρvD/μ (density × velocity × diameter / viscosity). Re < 2300: laminar flow (smooth, orderly). Re > 4000: turbulent flow (chaotic, mixed). Between: transitional. Essential for pipe design, predicting drag, and understanding fluid behavior. Determines friction factors and heat transfer coefficients.",

      "problem": "Water (ρ = 1000 kg/m³, μ = 0.001 Pa⋅s) flows at 2 m/s in 0.1m pipe. What is Re?",
      "solution": "200,000 (turbulent)",
      "steps": [
        "Re = ρvD/μ",
        "Re = 1000 × 2 × 0.1 / 0.001",
        "Re = 200 / 0.001 = 200,000",
        "Re > 4000, so flow is turbulent"
