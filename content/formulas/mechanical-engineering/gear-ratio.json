  "explanation": "Gear ratio (GR) equals the ratio of teeth (N₂/N₁), inverse ratio of angular velocities, and direct ratio of torques. Gears transmit power and change speed/torque. Larger gear ratio means more torque but less speed. Essential for designing gearboxes, transmissions, and power transmission systems. Power is conserved (ideally).",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Gear 1 (20 teeth) drives Gear 2 (60 teeth). What is gear ratio?",
      "solution": "3:1",
      "steps": [
        "GR = N₂/N₁ = 60/20 = 3",
        "Gear 2 rotates 3× slower but with 3× more torque"
      ]
    },
    {
      "problem": "If input rotates at 1000 RPM with 3:1 ratio, what is output speed?",
      "solution": "333.3 RPM",
      "steps": [
        "ω₂ = ω₁/GR",
        "ω₂ = 1000/3 = 333.3 RPM"
