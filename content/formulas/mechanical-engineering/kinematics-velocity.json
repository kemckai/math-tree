  "explanation": "Kinematic equations describe motion with constant acceleration. v = v₀ + at (velocity), x = v₀t + ½at² (position), v² = v₀² + 2ax (velocity-position relation). These are fundamental for analyzing motion of machines, vehicles, and mechanisms. Used in robotics, vehicle dynamics, and mechanism design.",
