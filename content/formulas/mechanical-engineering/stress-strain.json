  "explanation": "Stress (σ) is force per unit area, measuring internal forces in materials. Strain (ε) is the ratio of deformation to original length. Young's modulus (E) is the ratio of stress to strain, measuring material stiffness. These concepts are fundamental to mechanics of materials, used in designing structures, analyzing failures, and selecting appropriate materials.",

      "steps": [
        "σ = F/A",
