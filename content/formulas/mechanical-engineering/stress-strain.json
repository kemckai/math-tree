  "explanation": "Stress (\u03c3) is force per unit area, measuring internal forces in materials. Strain (\u03b5) is the ratio of deformation to original length. Young's modulus (E) is the ratio of stress to strain, measuring material stiffness. These concepts are fundamental to mechanics of materials, used in designing structures, analyzing failures, and selecting appropriate materials.",

      "problem": "A 10,000N force acts on a 0.01m\u00b2 cross-section. What is the stress?",

      "steps": [
        "\u03c3 = F/A",
        "\u03c3 = 10,000 / 0.01 = 1,000,000 Pa = 1 MPa"

        "\u03b5 = \u0394L/L\u2080",

  "proof": "\u03c3 = E\u03b5 (Hooke's law). Stress \u03c3 = F/A, strain \u03b5 = \u0394L/L. Young's modulus E = \u03c3/\u03b5. Linear relationship for small deformations. Beyond yield point, material deforms plastically. Derived from atomic bond stretching."
