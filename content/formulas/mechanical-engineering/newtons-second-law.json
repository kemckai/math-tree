  "explanation": "Newton's Second Law states that force equals mass times acceleration. This fundamental equation governs all mechanical motion. Force (F) is measured in newtons (N), mass (m) in kilograms (kg), and acceleration (a) in m/s\u00b2. This law is the foundation of dynamics and is used to analyze motion, design mechanisms, and calculate forces in mechanical systems.",

  "proof": "F = ma. Net force equals mass times acceleration. Foundation of mechanics. For constant mass: F = d(mv)/dt = m dv/dt = ma. For variable mass (rockets): F = ma + v(dm/dt). Used in all mechanical analysis."
