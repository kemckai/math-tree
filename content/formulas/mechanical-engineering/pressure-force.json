  "explanation": "Pressure (P) is force per unit area. Force equals pressure times area. This fundamental relationship is used in hydraulics, pneumatics, fluid systems, and structural analysis. Pressure is measured in pascals (Pa = N/m²) or commonly in bars, psi, or atmospheres. Essential for designing hydraulic systems, pressure vessels, and understanding fluid behavior.",

    {
      "problem": "A 1000N force acts on 0.01 m² area. What is pressure?",
      "solution": "100,000 Pa = 100 kPa",
      "steps": [
        "P = F/A",
        "P = 1000 / 0.01 = 100,000 Pa = 100 kPa"

      "problem": "Hydraulic pressure is 500 kPa acting on 0.02 m² piston. What force?",

        "F = PA",
