  "explanation": "Work (W) is force times distance in the direction of motion. Kinetic energy (KE) is energy of motion, proportional to mass and velocity squared. Potential energy (PE) is stored energy due to position (height). The work-energy theorem states that work equals change in kinetic energy. These concepts are fundamental for analyzing mechanical systems, efficiency, and energy conservation.",
