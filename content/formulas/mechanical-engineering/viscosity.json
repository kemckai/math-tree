  "explanation": "Viscosity (μ) measures a fluid's resistance to flow. Shear stress (τ) in a fluid equals viscosity times velocity gradient. This determines friction in fluid flow, lubrication, and drag forces. Dynamic viscosity is measured in Pa⋅s. Essential for analyzing fluid flow, designing lubrication systems, and understanding drag.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Oil (μ = 0.1 Pa⋅s) between plates: velocity gradient = 100 s⁻¹. What is shear stress?",
      "solution": "10 Pa",
      "steps": [
        "τ = μ(dv/dy)",
        "τ = 0.1 × 100 = 10 Pa"
