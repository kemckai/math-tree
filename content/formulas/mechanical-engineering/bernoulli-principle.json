  "latex": "P + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + \\rho gh = \\text{constant}",
  "explanation": "Bernoulli's principle states that in a flowing fluid, the sum of pressure, kinetic energy per volume, and potential energy per volume remains constant. This explains how aircraft wings generate lift, how venturis work, and fluid flow behavior. As velocity increases, pressure decreases (and vice versa). Essential for fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, and hydraulic systems.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Water flows through a pipe. At point 1: P\u2081 = 100 kPa, v\u2081 = 2 m/s. At point 2: v\u2082 = 4 m/s (same height). Find P\u2082.",
      "solution": "94 kPa (assuming \u03c1 = 1000 kg/m\u00b3)",
      "steps": [
        "P\u2081 + \u00bd\u03c1v\u2081\u00b2 = P\u2082 + \u00bd\u03c1v\u2082\u00b2 (same height, so \u03c1gh cancels)",
        "100,000 + \u00bd(1000)(2)\u00b2 = P\u2082 + \u00bd(1000)(4)\u00b2",
        "100,000 + 2000 = P\u2082 + 8000",
        "P\u2082 = 102,000 - 8000 = 94,000 Pa = 94 kPa"

  "proof": "P + \u00bd\u03c1v\u00b2 + \u03c1gh = constant. Conservation of energy for fluids. Proof: Work-energy theorem applied to fluid element. Pressure work + kinetic energy + potential energy constant along streamline. Assumes incompressible, inviscid, steady flow. Explains lift, Venturi effect."
