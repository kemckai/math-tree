  "explanation": "Carnot efficiency is the maximum possible efficiency for a heat engine operating between two temperatures. It depends only on the hot (T_H) and cold (T_C) reservoir temperatures (in Kelvin). No real engine can exceed this efficiency. This sets the theoretical limit for all heat engines, including steam turbines, internal combustion engines, and power plants.",
