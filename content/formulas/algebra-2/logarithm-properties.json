  "explanation": "Logarithms have three fundamental properties that mirror the properties of exponents. The product rule: log of a product equals sum of logs. The quotient rule: log of a quotient equals difference of logs. The power rule: log of a power equals exponent times log. These properties are essential for solving logarithmic equations and simplifying expressions.",

  "proof": "Product rule: log(ab) = log(a) + log(b). Proof: Let x = log(a), y = log(b), so a = 10^x, b = 10^y. Then ab = 10^x \u00d7 10^y = 10^(x+y). Taking log: log(ab) = x + y = log(a) + log(b). Quotient rule: log(a/b) = log(a) - log(b). Power rule: log(a^n) = n log(a). Both follow from product rule."
