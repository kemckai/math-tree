  "explanation": "Polynomial long division divides one polynomial by another, similar to numerical long division. The result is a quotient Q(x) and a remainder R(x) such that P(x) = D(x)Q(x) + R(x). This technique is useful for simplifying rational functions and finding factors. Synthetic division is a shortcut for dividing by linear factors.",

  "proof": "Polynomial long division: Divide leading terms, multiply, subtract, repeat. Remainder theorem: If P(x) divided by (x-a), remainder is P(a). Factor theorem: (x-a) is factor if and only if P(a) = 0. Synthetic division is shortcut for dividing by (x-a)."
