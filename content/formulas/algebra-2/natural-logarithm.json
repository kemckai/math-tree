  "explanation": "The natural logarithm, denoted ln, is the logarithm with base e (Euler's number, approximately 2.71828). It's called 'natural' because it arises naturally in calculus and many real-world applications. The natural logarithm has the same properties as other logarithms, and ln(e) = 1, ln(1) = 0.",
