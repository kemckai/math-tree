  "explanation": "The natural logarithm, denoted ln, is the logarithm with base e (Euler's number, approximately 2.71828). It's called 'natural' because it arises naturally in calculus and many real-world applications. The natural logarithm has the same properties as other logarithms, and ln(e) = 1, ln(1) = 0.",

  "proof": "ln(x) = \u222b[1 to x] 1/t dt. Defined as area under hyperbola. Properties: ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b) from integral properties. ln(a^n) = n ln(a). Derivative: d/dx[ln(x)] = 1/x. Inverse of e^x: e^(ln(x)) = x, ln(e^x) = x."
