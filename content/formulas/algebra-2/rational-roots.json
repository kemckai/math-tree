  "latex": "\\text{If } \\frac{p}{q} \\text{ is a root of } a_n x^n + ... + a_0, \\text{ then } p \\text{ divides } a_0 \\text{ and } q \\text{ divides } a_n",
  "explanation": "The Rational Root Theorem helps find possible rational roots of a polynomial. If p/q (in lowest terms) is a root, then p must divide the constant term and q must divide the leading coefficient. This narrows down candidates to test, making it easier to factor polynomials and find zeros.",
