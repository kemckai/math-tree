  "explanation": "An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference d. The nth term formula uses the first term a₁ and the common difference d. Arithmetic sequences model linear growth patterns, like counting by 2s, 5s, or any constant increment.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "Find the 10th term of the sequence 3, 7, 11, 15, ...",
      "solution": "39",
      "steps": [
        "First term: a₁ = 3",
        "Common difference: d = 7 - 3 = 4",
        "a₁₀ = 3 + (10 - 1)(4)",
