  "explanation": "The sum of an arithmetic series is the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence. The formula uses either the first and last terms, or the first term and common difference. This is useful for finding totals, like the sum of numbers 1 to 100, or calculating accumulated values in linear growth situations.",

  "proof": "Sum S_n = n/2(a\u2081 + a_n). Proof: Write series twice, once forward and once backward: S_n = a\u2081 + a\u2082 + ... + a_n, S_n = a_n + a_(n-1) + ... + a\u2081. Add: 2S_n = (a\u2081 + a_n) + (a\u2082 + a_(n-1)) + ... + (a_n + a\u2081). Each pair equals (a\u2081 + a_n) since terms are equidistant from ends. There are n pairs, so 2S_n = n(a\u2081 + a_n), therefore S_n = n/2(a\u2081 + a_n)."
