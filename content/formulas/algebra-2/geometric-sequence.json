  "explanation": "A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying by a constant ratio r. The nth term formula uses the first term a₁ and the common ratio r. Geometric sequences model exponential growth or decay, like doubling, halving, or any constant multiplication pattern.",
