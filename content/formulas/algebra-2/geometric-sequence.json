  "explanation": "A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying by a constant ratio r. The nth term formula uses the first term a\u2081 and the common ratio r. Geometric sequences model exponential growth or decay, like doubling, halving, or any constant multiplication pattern.",

  "proof": "For geometric sequence a, ar, ar\u00b2, ..., the nth term is a_n = ar^(n-1). Proof: Each term multiplies previous by r, so a\u2081 = a, a\u2082 = ar, a\u2083 = ar\u00b2, ..., a_n = ar^(n-1)."
