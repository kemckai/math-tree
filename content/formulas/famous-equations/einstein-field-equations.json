  "explanation": "Einstein's 1915 field equations describe how matter and energy curve spacetime, producing gravity. G_μν is the Einstein tensor (describing spacetime curvature), Λ is the cosmological constant, g_μν is the metric tensor, and T_μν is the stress-energy tensor (describing matter/energy). These equations revolutionized our understanding of gravity, predicting black holes, gravitational waves, and the expansion of the universe. They've been confirmed by observations of light bending, time dilation, and gravitational waves.",

  "proof": "Einstein derived these by requiring that the laws of physics be the same in all reference frames (general covariance) and that they reduce to Newton's gravity in weak fields. The left side describes geometry (spacetime curvature), the right side describes matter/energy."
