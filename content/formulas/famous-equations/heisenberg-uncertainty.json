  "explanation": "Werner Heisenberg's 1927 principle states that you cannot simultaneously know both the position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) of a particle with perfect precision. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other. ℏ = h/(2π) is the reduced Planck constant. This isn't a limitation of measurement—it's a fundamental property of nature. This principle revolutionized our understanding of reality and has profound philosophical implications.",

      "problem": "If an electron's position is measured to within 1 nm, what is the minimum uncertainty in its momentum?",

        "Δx Δp ≥ ℏ/2",

        "Δp ≥ ℏ/(2Δx)",
        "Δp ≥ (1.055 × 10⁻³⁴) / (2 × 10⁻⁹)",
        "Δp ≥ 5.27 × 10⁻²⁶ kg⋅m/s"

  "proof": "Heisenberg derived this from the mathematical properties of Fourier transforms and the wave nature of particles. The uncertainty comes from the non-commutativity of position and momentum operators in quantum mechanics: [x̂, p̂] = iℏ."
