  "explanation": "Isaac Newton's three laws (1687) form the foundation of classical mechanics. First Law: Objects maintain constant velocity unless acted upon by a force. Second Law: F = ma (force equals mass times acceleration). Third Law: For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. These laws describe motion from falling apples to orbiting planets and enabled the Industrial Revolution and space exploration.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "problem": "A 10 kg object accelerates at 5 m/s². What force is applied?",
      "solution": "50 N",
      "steps": [
        "F = ma",
        "F = 10 kg × 5 m/s²",

      "problem": "When you push a wall with 100 N of force, what happens?",
      "solution": "The wall pushes back with 100 N (Newton's Third Law)",
      "steps": [
        "Your force on wall: 100 N forward",
        "Wall's force on you: 100 N backward",
        "These forces are equal and opposite"
