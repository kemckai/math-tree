  "explanation": "James Clerk Maxwell's four equations (1861-1862) unified electricity, magnetism, and light into a single theory of electromagnetism. These equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and interact. The fourth equation predicted electromagnetic waves traveling at the speed of light, leading to the discovery that light itself is an electromagnetic wave. These equations are fundamental to all modern electronics, radio, and telecommunications.",
