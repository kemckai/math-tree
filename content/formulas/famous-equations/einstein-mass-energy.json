  "explanation": "Albert Einstein's most famous equation, published in 1905, states that energy (E) equals mass (m) times the speed of light (c) squared. This revolutionary equation revealed that mass and energy are equivalent and can be converted into each other. It's the foundation of nuclear energy and explains how the Sun produces energy through nuclear fusion. The equation shows that even a small amount of mass contains an enormous amount of energy, as c² is approximately 9 × 10¹⁶ m²/s².",

  "proof": "Derived from Einstein's special theory of relativity, combining the relativistic momentum and energy equations. The full relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², where p is momentum. For a particle at rest (p=0), this simplifies to E = mc²."
