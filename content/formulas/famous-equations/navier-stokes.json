  "explanation": "Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes's equations (1822-1845) describe the motion of fluid substances (liquids and gases). They are fundamental to fluid dynamics and are used in weather prediction, aircraft design, oceanography, and blood flow modeling. These nonlinear partial differential equations are so complex that finding general solutions is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, with a $1 million prize for a solution.",
