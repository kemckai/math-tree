  "explanation": "Erwin Schrödinger's 1926 wave equation is the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics. It describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. The equation relates the time evolution of the wavefunction ψ to the Hamiltonian operator Ĥ, which represents the total energy of the system. This equation revolutionized physics by providing a mathematical framework for atomic and subatomic behavior, explaining electron orbitals, chemical bonding, and quantum phenomena.",

      "problem": "For a free particle, the time-independent Schrödinger equation becomes -ℏ²/(2m) ∇²ψ = Eψ. What does this describe?",

      "steps": [
        "The Hamiltonian for a free particle is Ĥ = -ℏ²/(2m)∇²",
        "The equation -ℏ²/(2m)∇²ψ = Eψ is an eigenvalue equation",
        "Solutions are plane waves: ψ = e^(ik·r)",
        "This describes a particle with momentum p = ℏk"

  "proof": "Schrödinger derived this equation by seeking a wave equation that would reproduce the known energy levels of the hydrogen atom. He started with the classical wave equation and incorporated de Broglie's hypothesis that particles have wave-like properties with wavelength λ = h/p."
